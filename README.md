# SN-Aduty

## Required version
- ESX 1.94 Legacy (bis Version 1.10.1)

## About
This is a simple admin-mode project that allows users of a specific group to change into a special "on duty mode".  This mode automatically:
- Gods the player
- Changes their ESX job to an on-duty version

Upon Disabling admin mode, the resource:
- Ungods the player
- Returns their ESX Job back to where it was before
- Removes the admin vehicle (unreliable at the current point)
- Resets the player's ped to the ESX skin (looking to change to last ped to work with EUP)

## Commands
- /tpm \[ID\] - Accepts the assist from the specified player and teleports to them
- /a - Toggle the player into admin mode.
- /v - Toggle the player into Invisible
- /9 - Toggle the plaer into noclip
